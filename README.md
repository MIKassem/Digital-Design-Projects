#Digital Systems Design Projects

This repository includes two digital design projects developed using SystemVerilog:

## 🚀 Project 1: 8-Bit Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)
A combinational circuit performing 12 operations, including addition, subtraction, min/max, and circular/logical shifts.

### Files:
- `8-bit-ALU.sv`: Main ALU design
- `testbench-ALU.sv`: ALU testbench

## 🚦 Project 2: Traffic Light Controller
A sequential circuit using an FSM and counter to manage traffic light states based on input sensor data.

### Files:
- `traffic_light_controller.sv`: Traffic light FSM and counter
- `testbench-traffic-light.sv`: Testbench simulating car presence scenarios

## 🧪 Simulation
Each project includes a testbench and can be simulated using ModelSim or any compatible SystemVerilog simulator.
