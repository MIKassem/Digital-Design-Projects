# Digital-Design-Projects
8-Bit ALU: Implemented a modular unit supporting arithmetic, logical, and bit-shift operations using opcode control | Traffic Light Controller: Built an FSM with timing counters to simulate intelligent intersection control via sensor input. | Both projects included rigorous simulation, testing with structured testbenches, and waveform documentation
